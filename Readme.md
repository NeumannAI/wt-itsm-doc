# **Goals & Objective**

The **purpose** of this Manual is to provide an overview of the Watad
ITSM system and ensure that users get the most out of all the services
provided.

The **objectives** of this Manual are to: 

-   Provide clear reference to get all the essential information.

-   Present a clear, concise, and measurable description of service provision to the customer.

-   Match perceptions of expected service provision with actual service support & delivery. 

## **System Overview**

Watad ITSM is an IT service management system that helps our customers manage all their network assets. Watad ITSM's mission is to provide high-quality customer support and ensure the provisioning of services required to support and maintain customer satisfaction. Using the Watad ITSM site, the ITSM system will facilitate communication between consumers and service providers, including feature requests and incident requests. The portal will be available 24 /7 to receive client requests, which will be processed promptly in the system and allocated to one engineer who will take appropriate action. This document will walk you through the steps of using Watad ITSM.

# 
HOW TO REQUEST A TICKET?

User can request ticket to express the need by three different ways as mentioned bellow:    

1-	User can submit a request from “ www.support.watadenergy.com” see (Submit a request from Watad ITSM system) .
